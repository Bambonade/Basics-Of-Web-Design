<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<dl>
  <strong><dt>What is a yurt?</dt></strong>
  <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
    Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened</dd>
  <strong><dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt></strong>
  <dd>Each yurt is finished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
    Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
    running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
  <strong><dt>What should I bring?</dt></strong>
  <dd>Most quests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with
    light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
